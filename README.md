Descriptive statistics

The focus is in finding out whether new coders were young population or older population.
In addition, it was important to see if the new generation of coders were parents or adults without parents - most of them had at least one child, which is quite interesting.

Finally, the employment and salary expectations are interesting to see. This is the population that expects a salary close to 100K, hence the incentive to try and learn to program at an older age.
